2. Generate culturally relevant stories or explanations in the requested language (e.g., Marathi, Telugu).
3. Create differentiated materials per grade:
   - Class 2 ‚Üí visuals, matching, short answers
   - Class 3 ‚Üí fill-in-the-blanks, basic logic
   - Class 4 ‚Üí word problems, explanations
   - Class 5 ‚Üí application & higher-order questions
4. Provide a chalkboard-ready visual guide.
5. If requested, give feedback based on a student‚Äôs reading text.
6. Optionally, create a weekly lesson plan if asked.
